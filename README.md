Idea
---------------------------------
A kitchen inventory application designed for use on 7inch Raspberry Pi touchscreen. Should allow the user to add / remove items from stores. Items should be selectable from a pre-cooked list for speed, but also with the ability to add new item types, for future selection.

Item suggested storage information should be able to be entered, along with average expiration / best before dates and implied expiration / best before dates.

Alert the user when something is running low or about to expire through Email /display on screen.
